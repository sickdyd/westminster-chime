## Westminster Chime

A simple project that allows to set at what interval you want to hear the Westminster chime play.

## Motivation

I want to have a notification every hour or so to stand up from my desk and do some stretching. I tried to use the Mac OS announcer but it randomly fails, the voices are weird and it mixes up languages.
